# First Steps into Functional Programming
A super fun(ctional) programming workshop by [@AnjanaVakil](https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil)

## Why am I here?

In recent years you may have found yourself hearing more and more about this trendy topic of “functional programming", from a bunch of excited coders enthusiastically gushing about how it helps them write elegant, modular code that's easier to test, debug, and reason about. If you're like me, you may have started wondering:

- What is functional programming anyway, and why are people so excited about it?
- What does functional code look like? How is it different from imperative or OO code?
- What tools do I need to write functional programs? Do I have to learn Haskell? (spoiler alert: no!)

If you too have been asking yourself questions like these, please join me in this friendly, practical exploration of functional programming fundamentals.

## What will we learn in this workshop?

We'll learn how to follow the basic principles of the functional programming paradigm, such as:
- construct programs from pure, “input in-output out” functions through which data flows
- use higher-order functions like map & filter instead of iterative loops, and closures instead of objects & classes
- avoid mutation (changing things in-place), and use immutable data structures for efficiency

## Outline

- Intro & icebreakers
- Functional Programming in a nutshell
  - Functions vs. Pure Functions
  - Side Effects, and how to live without them (most of the time)
  - Imperative vs. Declarative programming
- Functions all the way down
  - Function composition
  - Program === Function
  - Data flow 
- Flying first class
  - Functions as values
  - Closures
  - Currying
- And now, a word from our sponsors: The Lambda Calculus
- FP: Enemy of the State
  - Time, state, and sanity
  - Immutable data and you
- And now, a word from our sponsors: Persistent Data Structures
